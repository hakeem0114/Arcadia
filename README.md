Redux Tookit, Persist & Devtools 
```
Rather than setting up & connecting the state management and then praying that it works, redux devtools is as critical as the Postman & chrome devtools.
Persist to store cache (redux store payload-> states -> initialValues & action to mutate with action in reducers) on user's local storage. Keep states on browser refresh
```

React Toastify
```
Handle notifications
```

Firebase
```
    Stores user info for authentication & authorization
```

## Technologies Used

## ERD Diagrams

Introduction Page
```
  Although my project "MySymposium" worked perfectly on localhost, the client-side rendering after deploying the backend node.js server was occasionally slow. 
  Making on introduction page to let the end-user wait for the store to load is something I felt was need in my next full-stack application (this project).

  Get loading priority & renders the store before the welcome icon pops up

Firebase Storage, Authentication & Authorization
