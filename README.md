## ERD Diagrams

Introduction Page
```
  Although my project "MySymposium" worked perfectly on localhost, the client-side rendering after deploying the backend node.js server was occasionally slow. 
  Making on introduction page to let the end-user wait for the store to load is something I felt was need in my next full-stack application (this project).

  Get loading priority & renders the store before the welcome icon pops up
